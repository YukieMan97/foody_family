First Android application project created on Android Studio at BC Hacks Hackathon. 

I wanted to make an Android application in this Hackathon because I have never made one. 
Our team could have easily made a website and probably finish our project way sooner, but 
we took this challenge instead.

There were a lot of obstacles:
  - learning to use Android Studio for the first time
  - designing the layout of the each page 
  - using Google Maps in our app (we did not reach this stage)
  
We basically only had the time to finish the layout of the app. Although we didn't complete
the app as intended to, I was happy and proud of the outcome! I learned many things such as   
coding in Kotlin and xml. Also, I eventually learned how quickly make a layout. It was 
difficult at first because we ran into so many small errors such as using the wrong layout  
form and importing the wrong files. So now, if I were to make and design several pages, 
that would not be a problem anymore!

I tried to implement the register and login functions, but we ran out of time. If I were 
to improve my way of making an app, I would probably focus a bit on the implementation
and design at the same time. During this hackathon, we only focused on the design first, which 
left no time for the function implementation.

Overall, I had a great experience at BC Hacks! I enjoyed the workshops and events they provided
and how this mini app turned out. I'm looking forward to improving this app during the school
break!
